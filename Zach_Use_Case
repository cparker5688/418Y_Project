Title: Swipe Through Restaurants

Description:
This use case covers the scenario where a customer navigates through available happy hour deals using a swipe-based interface. 
The interface presents each restaurant with images, key details, and deal specifics so the customer can quickly assess and 
decide which venues to explore further.

Primary Actor:
Customer

Preconditions:
The customer is logged into the application.
The customer’s location is enabled and accessible.
The application has active happy hour deals and restaurant data loaded.
The customer has optionally set preferences for food, drink, or other deal attributes.

Postconditions:
A restaurant is either matched or dismissed.
The customer’s swipe history is updated, allowing for later review or comparison.

Main Success Scenario:
The customer launches the app and is directed to the swipe interface.
The app displays a restaurant card with images, deal details, and key highlights.
The customer reviews the restaurant information and swipes right to indicate interest.
The system evaluates the swipe against the customer’s pre-set preferences.
If the restaurant’s offerings meet or exceed the preferences threshold, it is added to the customer’s matched list.
The customer continues swiping to view more deals.

Extensions:
Invalid Location Data: If the app cannot determine the customer’s location, a prompt is shown to enable location services.
Network Error: If there is a connectivity issue while swiping, the app displays an error message and suggests retrying.
Expired Deal: If a restaurant’s happy hour deal has expired, the app marks it as inactive and does not include it in the swipe sequence.

Frequency of Use:
High – Customers are likely to use the swipe feature multiple times during happy hours.
