Swipe interface would be similar to dating apps such as tinder, where users can quickly swipe through nearby venues with active happy hour deals. Location based searching gives users the ability to display venues within a specified radius of their current location. Deal details will allow each venue to showcase their food and drink offers and times. Favoriting venues allows users to favorite their preferred and favorite spots for easy access. Review and Rating systems allow users to rate venues based on their expereince and leave feedback for other users. And filtering options would allow users to filter by prive, distance, type of offer, or time of day.
