The purpose of the project is to create an intuituve app that users can use to assist in finding the best happy hour deals. The app will include features such as a swipe interface, location based searching, deal deatils, favorite venues, review and rating system, and filtering options.

**Briefly describe each of the features you plan to implement.**

Swipe interface would be similar to dating apps such as tinder, where users can quickly swipe through nearby venues with active happy hour deals. A match would be populated if the users pre-selected preferences match up to the restarunts offerings. Location based searching gives users the ability to display venues within a specified radius of their current location. Deal details will allow each venue to showcase their food and drink offers and times. Favoriting venues allows users to favorite their preferred and favorite spots for easy access. Review and Rating systems allow users to rate venues based on their expereince and leave feedback for other users. The filtering option would allow users to filter by type of food/beverage, price, type of offer, or time of day.
